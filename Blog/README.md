**DevOps Scaling**

> _state the problem_ <br>
The system often experience break down or crushing performance due to huge amount of users' requests.

> _say why it is interesting_ <br>
Scaling can be really painful when the number of users grow, as well as the system.

> _say what your solution achieves_ <br>
Massive requests can be solved by enhancing the scalability of the system with the use different strategies such as vertical/horizontal scaling, or services scaled with Docker Swarm.

> _say what follows from your solution_ <br>
