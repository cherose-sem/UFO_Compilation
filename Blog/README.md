**DevOps Scaling**
- Software application can often experience break down or system crash due to huge amount of users' requests.
- Scaling is becoming cost-effective as the number of users increases, as well as when the system is growing and developed in time.
- Massive requests failure can be solved by enhancing the scalability of the system with the use of different strategies such as vertical/horizontal scaling, or services scaled with Docker Swarm.
- We chose to scale the Hackernews project using horizontal scaling and Docker swarm. chose to scale HackerNews project using horizontal scaling using Docker Swarm cluster.
